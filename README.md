# Anti Hate filter

## Task

The goal of this project is to classify different comments base on their toxicity.

## Models

### Base Model: Logistic Regression with ChainClassifier

We have implemented a Logistic Regression with a Chain classifier to handle multilabel classification. This model is the baseline for our classification task.

### Advanced Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

For the more sophisticated approach, we have employed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNNs are particularly well-suited for sequence data, making them a powerful choice for tasks involving natural language processing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).
